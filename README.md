# Welcome to my repository
This is a grabbag of repositories for what ever I am working on.
## personaliae

A fan of hetogenous programming I choose a language depending on how suitable it is for the job I want to do.

## This cite
I use reposetories as offcite backup so a lot of it is not intended for public use.
I am also the manager of pandora-norway a company that I run. We develop software for autonomous quadcopters.
In time I hope to write more on that project here but if you want to know what it is about check out www.pandoranorge.com
